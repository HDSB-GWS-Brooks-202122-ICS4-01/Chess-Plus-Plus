# Chess Plus Plus
A sophisticated chess application built in JavaFX by [Akil Pathiranage](https://github.com/akilpath) and [Selim Abdelwahab](https://github.com/SelimAbdelwahab) for their ICS4U final project. The application was built from the ground up in 3 weeks. 

Allows for a regular pass and play mode along with the ability to save games so that way they can be continued later. Utilizes Firebase hosting to register accounts, store player statistics and allow for matchmaking online with other users. Users can also play against a rookie A.I. which was developed using a minimax algorithm.
